# 452 Labs

Copy of original solution from course CSE 452, by Sandra Anderson and Josh Nazarin.

The project assignment can be found from the course website here: http://courses.cs.washington.edu/courses/cse452/16wi/

The module organization and marshalling code was provided as part of the project assignment, with stub methods for students to fill in.

We split the work by alternating leading on each project, although both helped with all of the code writing and debugging. 

Sandra was primarily responsible for labs: 2b, 3b, 4a, 5.
Josh was primarily responsible for labs: 1, 3a, 4b.
Lab 2a was tightly collaborative.
